Goal

This tool automatically converts a C project into C++.
It requires the python interpreter (2.0 or above) installed.
It is useful:
- to make a C program a reusable component.
- to avoid name conflicts on large programs, especially if
you include external libraries.
- to use overloading, templates or other object-oriented features.


Description

The main program is ctocpp.py that performs successive stages for
converting C to C++. A script, ctocpp gives it as parameter to
the python interpreter with options you add.

The archive also includes scripts that may help you:
- mover.py changes the location of a project.
- search.py performs searches and replacements.
- mkheader.py corrects a header file.


License

The C to C++ program with all the python sources is under the GNU GPL license, 
that minds you may use it and distribute it freely, providing the copyright 
is unchanged.
See at the COPYING file for details. This doesn't mean GNU
encourages you to convert your C sources to C++. In fact, most of
the tools here included may help C programmers outside C++ conversion.


Installing

Type: 
./configure
./setup
mkdoc      ...this will generate an html and info manuals.

For more options, see at the INSTALL file


Instructions

Before to convert your own project, read carefully the manual.
If you can,print it.
It may be preferable also to apply a file formatter as astyle on your
sources - there are lot of such other tools on the web - to make
the code easier to process by the converter.
